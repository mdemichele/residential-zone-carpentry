      <p>I attribute my acquired dexterity and artistic eye for detailed carpentry from my childhood shadowing my woodworker, oil painter, welder, gardener of a grandpa. After graduating college with a degree in local government administration I decided to invest all of my time in the craft of building which I have long admired. Now I do all I can to learn about the ways of bulding for my enjoyment and for the service of others. I am inspired by Italian Renaissance, Bavarian, and Japanese architecture. I also enjoy high contrast color schemes.
